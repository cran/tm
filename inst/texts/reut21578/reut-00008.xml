  <TITLE>USX &lt;X&gt; DEBT DOWGRADED BY MOODY&apos;S</TITLE>
  <DATELINE>NEW YORK, Feb 26 -</DATELINE>
  <BODY>Moody&apos;s Investors Service Inc said it
lowered the debt and preferred stock ratings of USX Corp and
its units. About seven billion dlrs of securities is affected.
    Moody&apos;s said Marathon Oil Co&apos;s recent establishment of up
to one billion dlrs in production payment facilities on its
prolific Yates Field has significant negative implications for
USX&apos;s unsecured creditors.
    The company appears to have positioned its steel segment
for a return to profit by late 1987, Moody&apos;s added.
    Ratings lowered include those on USX&apos;s senior debt to BA-1
from BAA-3.
